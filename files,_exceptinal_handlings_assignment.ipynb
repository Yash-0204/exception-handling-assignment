        "    Can catch more errors at compile-time.\n",
        "    Cons:\n",
        "    Slower to test and debug (you have to recompile every time).\n",
        "    Platform-dependent unless specially handled.  \n",
        "    Interpreted Languages\n",
        "    Definition: The code is read and executed line-by-line by an interpreter at runtime.\n",
        "    Process:\n",
        "    You write the code.\n",
        "    The interpreter runs it directly.\n",

        "Q.2 What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Ans. An exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. Common examples:\n",
        "    Trying to divide by zero (ZeroDivisionError)\n",
        "    Accessing a file that doesn’t exist (FileNotFoundError)\n",
        "    Using a variable that hasn't been defined (NameError)\n",
        "    Components are try(), except(), else(), finally()\n",
        "    They are widely because Prevents your program from crashing unexpectedly.\n",
        "    Makes your code more robust and user-friendly.\n",
        "    Allows you to define how to respond to different error types.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.3 What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Ans. The finally block is used to define cleanup actions that must happen, whether an exception was raised or not. Guarantees execution: Code inside finally will always run—after try and any except blocks. Useful for cleanup tasks, like: Closing a file or database connection, Releasing resources (e.g., memory, locks), Logging final messages, Resetting states\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.4 What is logging in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Ans. Logging in Python is a way to record messages from your code — kind of like a journal or black box that tracks what your program is doing. It helps with debugging, monitoring, and understanding what's happening during execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.5 What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Ans. It is a special method in Python, also called a destructor.\n",
        "    It’s called automatically when an object is about to be destroyed (i.e., garbage collected).\n",
        "\n",
        "    Used to clean up resources when an object is no longer needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Think of it like the opposite of __init__ (which sets up an object).\n",
        "    Commonly used for:\n",
        "    Closing files\n",
        "    Releasing memory or network resources\n",
        "    Logging destruction of objects\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.6 What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Ans. import module- This brings in the whole module. You need to use the module name to access its contents.\n",
        "    Example- import math\n",
        "    print(math.sqrt(16))  # You access sqrt via math.sqrt\n",
        "    It is really Good for clarity (you always know where things are coming from).\n",
        "\n",
        "    from module import- This imports just a specific part of the module (like a function or class). You can use it directly without the module name.\n",
        "    Example- from math import sqrt\n",
        "    print(sqrt(16))  # No need to prefix with math.\n",
        "    It is Cleaner and shorter, but you lose the context of where the function came from.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.7 How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Ans.  In Python, handling multiple exceptions is really flexible — you can handle different types of errors in one block or separately, depending on what you need.\n",
        "    Like using Multiple except Blocks, One except for Multiple Exceptions, Catch All Exceptions, Using else and finally.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.8 What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Ans. The with statement is used to simplify file handling by automatically managing resources like file objects.\n",
        "    It ensures your file is automatically closed, even if an error occurs during file operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.9 F What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Ans. Multithreading (One Process, Many Threads)\n",
        "    Runs multiple threads in a single process.\n",
        "    Threads share the same memory space.\n",
        "    Good for I/O-bound tasks (like reading files, network requests, etc.).\n",
        "    Limited by the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) in CPython, so not ideal for CPU-heavy tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Example use case: Downloading multiple web pages at the same time.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Multiprocessing (Multiple Processes)\n",
        "    Runs multiple processes, each with its own Python interpreter and memory space.\n",
        "    Good for CPU-bound tasks (like heavy calculations, data processing).Bypasses the GIL, so it can use multiple CPU cores.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Example use case: Performing heavy data analysis on large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.10 What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Ans. Logging is like having a behind-the-scenes narrator for your program. It tells you what’s happening, when, and where — which is super valuable in real-world apps.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Advantages are as follows\n",
        "    1. Better debugging\n",
        "    2. keeps the history\n",
        "    3. way more flexible than others\n",

        "    5. Cleaner and scalable code etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.11 What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Ans. Memory management in Python refers to how the interpreter allocates, uses, and frees up memory while your program runs. Python does this automatically behind the scenes, but it has some cool features and behaviors worth knowing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.12 What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Ans. Basic Steps in Exception Handling in Python\n",
        "    Step 1 - using try block\n",
        "    2- using Except block\n",
        "    3- using else block\n",
        "    4- Finally block\n",
        "\n",
        "    Example;\n",
        "    try:\n",
        "       x = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
        "       result = 10 / x\n",
        "    except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
        "       print(\"Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n",
        "    except ValueError:\n",
        "       print(\"Please enter a valid number.\")\n",
        "    else:\n",
        "       print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
        "    finally:\n",
        "       print(\"Execution complete.\")\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.13 Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Ans. It is important as it Prevents Memory Leaks, Improves Performance, Manages Large Data Efficiently, Automatic Garbage Collection, Avoids Program Crashes, Scales Better.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.14 What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Ans. Together, they let your program catch and handle errors gracefully, instead of crashing.\n",
        "    try Block – Where the Risky Code Lives\n",
        "    You put code inside try that might raise an exception.If everything runs smoothly, Python skips the except block. If an error happens, Python jumps to except.\n",
        "    except Block – What to Do When Things Go Wrong\n",
        "    Catches the specific exception (like ZeroDivisionError) and handles it.\n",
        "    Prevents the program from crashing.Can print an error, log it, retry, or even raise a new one.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.15 How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Ans. Python’s garbage collection system is a behind-the-scenes process that automatically manages memory by reclaiming memory used by objects that are no longer needed, helping your programs run efficiently without memory leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.16 What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Ans. The else block is used to define code that should run only if no exceptions are raised in the try block. It helps to separate normal execution code (that runs if everything goes fine) from error handling code (in the except block). It ensures that any logic you want to execute only when there are no exceptions is clearly separated and runs after the try block, but before the finally block (if used).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.17 What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Ans. The logging module allows you to log messages at different severity levels. These levels help categorize messages so you can filter and control what gets logged based on their importance.\n",
        "\n",
        "    1- DEBUG-  For detailed debugging information, typically useful for diagnosing problems.\n",
        "    2- INFO- For informational messages that show the normal flow of the application.\n",
        "    3- WARNING- For potential problems or situations that may need attention, but aren't critical.\n",
        "    4- ERROR- For errors that occur during execution and may cause problems, but the program can continue running.\n",
        "    5- CRITICAL- For severe errors that may cause the program to stop or have serious consequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.18 What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Ans. Both os.fork() and the multiprocessing module in Python are used for creating parallel processes, but they work in different ways and have distinct use cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Lets differentiate\n",
        "    os.fork()- Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS),0Parent and child share memory (copy-on-write)Low-level; manual management of resources, Difficult to manage directly, System-level tasks, limited use cases, Not available on Windows\n",
        "    \n",
        "    multiprocessing- Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows)Separate memory space for each process, High-level; handles resource management, synchronization, and IPC automatically, Built-in support for queues, pipes, and more, Parallel processing, CPU-bound tasks, easier to manageFully available on Windows as well.\n",
        "    \n",
        "Q.19 What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Ans. Closing files in Python is an essential practice for managing resources efficiently. Here’s why:\n",
        "    1- By closing the file, you free up those resources, allowing the system to reuse them for other tasks.\n",
        "    2- Closing a file ensures that any remaining data in the buffer is flushed (written to the disk).\n",
        "    3- Closing the file properly ensures that the file is closed safely, preventing any potential corruption. etc\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.20 What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Ans. Both file.read() and file.readline() are used for reading files in Python, but they work differently and serve distinct purposes. Let’s differentiate the key differences:\n",
        "\n",
        "    file.read()- The entire file or specified number of bytes,\tCan use a lot of memory if the file is large, Returns a single string, Moves to the end of the file after reading, When you need the entire content of the file.\n",
        "\n",
        "    file.readline()- One line at a timeMore memory efficient, as it reads one line at a time, Returns a string containing a single line, Moves to the next line after each call, When you need to process the file line-by-line.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.21 What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Ans. The logging module in Python is an essential tool for tracking and recording log messages during the execution of your program. It allows you to log information about your program's execution, errors, warnings, and other important events, helping you to debug, monitor, and maintain your code effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.22 What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Ans. The os module in Python is part of the standard library and provides a way to interact with the operating system. When it comes to file handling, the os module offers a range of functions to work with files and directories. This includes creating, removing, and manipulating files and directories, as well as getting information about files.\n",
        "    different types of os modules are-\n",
        "    1- os.rename() – Rename a File or Directory\n",
        "    2- os.remove() – Delete a File\n",

        "Q.24 How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Ans. In Python, you can raise an exception manually using the raise keyword. This is useful when you want to explicitly signal an error condition in your program. You can raise built-in exceptions or create your own custom exceptions.raise ExceptionType(\"message\") is used to manually raise built-in exceptions.You can also create custom exception classes by inheriting from Exception.Exceptions can be raised conditionally based on your program’s logic. raise without an exception can be used to re-raise the last caught exceptio\n",
